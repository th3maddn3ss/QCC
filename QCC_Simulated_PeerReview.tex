\section*{Overview}
This document simulates a peer review roundtable of the Quantum Coherence Cosmology (QCC) model. It features six diverse and representative reviewer personas, each critiquing the framework from a different scientific domain. All responses are provided in anticipation of real-world feedback.

\section*{Reviewer 1 – Dr. K. Relm (General Relativity)}
\textbf{Comment:} The proposed $\phi(z,\tau)$ coherence field framework resembles scalar-tensor gravity or quintessence but introduces field behavior without a clear physical mechanism. What mediates the $\phi$-field? If it's derived from CMB FFTs, what prevents this from being pure data-fitting rather than physics-based derivation? The evolution equation appears to be constructed post hoc from residuals rather than first principles.

\textbf{Response:} $\phi(z,\tau)$ is derived from the harmonic structure of the Planck PCCS 030 GHz signal, not fit to cosmological datasets. Its evolution follows from wavelet behavior observed across cosmic redshift. No tuning is involved. The model uses an Euler–Lagrange formulation grounded in CMB-derived memory. The $\phi$-field represents informational coherence, not a new force carrier.

\section*{Reviewer 2 – Dr. M. S. Debra (Quantum Field Theory)}
\textbf{Comment:} If QCC posits coherence bursts or "geyser events", does it predict particle creation? Does $\phi(z,\tau)$ couple to known fields like EM or Higgs? Without gauge symmetry, it seems this is just a classical scalar field overlaid on quantum structure.

\textbf{Response:} Coherence burst thresholds in $\phi''(z)$ correlate with emergence of particles in QCC simulations. These are not arbitrary events but memory-driven peaks. Couplings to SM fields are not assumed a priori but may be explored if empirical validation supports them. The coherence field framework is geometrically QFT-compatible but deliberately agnostic to specific gauge interactions until tested.

\section*{Reviewer 3 – Dr. J. Arias (Quantum Information Theory)}
\textbf{Comment:} Using CMB harmonics to build a dynamic scalar field is novel, but are there mapping assumptions from $\ell$-space to redshift that create phantom structures? Could residual minimization across datasets introduce bias?

\textbf{Response:} QCC uses a log-stretched inversion calibrated against BAO peak position. The harmonic structure is extracted from Planck PCCS, then applied to datasets with fixed envelope sizes and no per-dataset tuning. Residuals are calculated after the field is generated — ensuring external validation.

\section*{Reviewer 4 – Dr. L. Chao (CMB Signal Processing)}
\textbf{Comment:} Deriving a scalar field from PCCS 030 GHz is unconventional. Could your coherence wavelet be an artifact of the gimbal projection or residual noise?

\textbf{Response:} The gimbal projection and FFT technique isolates harmonic features invariant under beam smoothing. The PCCS catalog avoids large-scale foregrounds. The coherence field structure persists across phase domains, and residuals across multiple datasets suggest physical correlation, not projection artifacts.

\section*{Reviewer 5 – Dr. T. Mahajan (Particle Cosmology)}
\textbf{Comment:} Without inflation or dark matter, how does QCC explain early structure formation or the acoustic peaks in the CMB?

\textbf{Response:} QCC incorporates harmonic features directly from the PCCS signal, preserving the angular structure of the CMB. The coherence field forms entropic wells that seed structure in lieu of dark matter. Inflation is reinterpreted as a primordial coherence burst that generated the standing waves now embedded in $\phi(z,\tau)$.

\section*{Reviewer 6 – Dr. E. Sato (Entropy and Thermodynamics)}
\textbf{Comment:} How is entropy rigorously defined in this framework? Is the term metaphorical, thermodynamic, or quantum informational?

\textbf{Response:} QCC defines entropy as loss of information coherence — a quantum information-theoretic measure. As coherence in $\phi(z,\tau)$ decays, structure formation and redshift emerge as observable consequences of informational entropy, not just thermodynamic processes. This bridges cosmology with entropy in a falsifiable, data-bound way.

🚀 Quantum Coherence Cosmology (QCC)

README and Full Theory Log
A reproducible, data-anchored cosmological framework that replaces ΛCDM using quantum coherence memory fields extracted from the CMB.

🔸 Overview

Quantum Coherence Cosmology (QCC) is a cosmological model that reinterprets dark matter and dark energy as emergent effects of a scalar coherence memory field φ(z, τ), derived directly from the Planck Compact Source Catalog (PCCS 030 GHz). This field encodes quantum memory from the early universe, enabling QCC to reproduce cosmic structure, redshift expansion, and gravitational lensing phenomena—without fitting parameters or empirical tuning.

🧠 QCC Field Construction

QCC defines the scalar field from CMB echoes as:

φ(z, τ) = μ(z) − ν(z)

μ(z): Extracted from TT peaks (information bursts/coherence eruptions)

ν(z): Extracted from TT troughs (memory wells / structure sinks)

z → ℓ mapping: Done via FFT on 720° gimbal projection of GLON/DETFLUX from COM_PCCS_030

Redshift transform: log-stretched projection, scaled via dataset coupling or Planck TT


The φ(z, τ) field evolves dynamically with τ (proper time), capturing coherence decay, feedback loops, and gravitational softening.

📜 Canonical Lagrangian

The QCC model is derived from a field-theoretic basis using:

ℒ(φ) = (1/2) g^μν ∂_μ φ ∂_ν φ − V(φ)

Where the potential is:

V(φ) = (1/2) m² φ² + (λ/4) φ⁴ + α·e^(−βz)·φ

Parameters:

m: coherence wave carrier mass (from field envelope)

λ: self-interference coefficient

α, β: redshift echo constants (from memory wave decay)


This Lagrangian supports Euler–Lagrange dynamic field evolution and natural feedback via particle production, lensing, and decoherence scaling.

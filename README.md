## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This repository contains the full theoretical framework and computational pathway for the **Quantum Coherence Cosmology (QCC)** model. QCC reframes dark matter and dark energy as emergent effects of quantum coherence seeded in the early universe and echoing through spacetime.

This model:
- Extracts coherence structure directly from Planck PCCS 030 GHz CMB data
- Uses wavelet transforms (Daubechies-4) to construct a dynamic scalar field \( \phi(z) \)
- Derives full classical and quantum field equations
- Applies the Ï†-field to cosmological datasets: Pantheon+, KiDS, DR9Q, BAO, GWTC
- Demonstrates predictive accuracy via RMS residuals and correlation metrics

### ðŸ”¬ Field Derivation

The scalar coherence field \( \phi(z) \) is derived via:

```math
\phi(z) = \mu(z) - \nu(z)

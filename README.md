# Quantum Coherence Theory (QCT): A Static Structure Model of Dark Matter Encoded in CMB Harmonics

This repository contains all files and data for the structural formulation of **Quantum Coherence Theory (QCT)**, a scalar field framework that models dark matter as quantum coherence memory encoded in the CMB temperature spectrum.

> üîç QCT does not propose new particles or modify General Relativity, but instead reconstructs a *static structure model* from CMB harmonic memory. The resulting coherence fields (œÜ, Œº, ŒΩ) align with cosmic structure across Pantheon+, KiDS, DR9Q, GWTC, and BAO ‚Äî without parameter tuning.

## üì¶ Datasets and Cleaning Summary

| Dataset      | Source File | Observable | QCT Field | Cleaning Notes |
|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Pantheon+    | `hlsp_ps1cosmo_panstarrs_gpc1_all_multi_v1_snparams.txt` | Distance modulus \( m_B(z) \) | œÜ(z) | Removed z ‚â§ 0; kept (z, mB, error) only |
| KiDS         | `KiDS_XIP.txt` | Shear correlation \( \xi_+(\theta) \) | ŒΩ(z) | Filtered non-numeric; mapped angle to redshift |
| DR9Q         | `DR9Q.dat` | Quasar histogram | Œº(z) | Extracted z column; histogrammed (0.1 < z < 5) |
| GWTC         | `GWTC_Data.txt` | Merger redshift | œÜ(z) | Removed outliers and invalid z |
| BAO          | `Beutler_etal_DR12COMBINED_BAO_powspec` | \( P(k) \) vs \( k \) | œÜ(z) | Converted \( k \) to z via \( z \sim 0.3/k \) |

CMB Source:
- `COM_PowerSpect_CMB-TT-full_R3.01.txt` ‚Äî Planck TT spectrum used to extract œÜ, Œº, ŒΩ via harmonic peak and trough mapping.

All cleaning is fully described in the **‚ÄúData Cleaning and Preprocessing Rationale‚Äù** section of the preprint.

## üìò How to Reproduce

1. Extract CMB peaks and troughs from TT spectrum.
2. Map multipoles to redshift using \( z_i = \frac{1100}{\ell_i + \epsilon} \)
3. Construct œÜ(z) as:  
   \[
   \phi(z) = \sum A_{\text{peak}} e^{-(z - z_{\text{peak}})^2 / 2\lambda^2} - \sum A_{\text{trough}} e^{-(z - z_{\text{trough}})^2 / 2\lambda^2}
   \]
4. Normalize and overlay against each dataset.
5. Evaluate RMS and correlation (Pearson, Spearman).

Python/NumPy/MATLAB implementations can be built using these equations directly.

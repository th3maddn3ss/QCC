\section{Introduction}
This checkpoint documents the comparison between the experimental Higgs echo mechanism reported in arXiv:2312.10912v1 / Science Advances DOI 10.1126/sciadv.ads8740 and the Quantum Coherence Cosmology (QCC) v2.2a model's cosmological echo. The analysis frames the experimental discovery as a microscopic analogue of the QCC coherence echo, providing a potential empirical bridge between quantum condensed matter and cosmological-scale phenomena.

\section{Higgs Echo Experimental Mechanism}
The experiment uses two phase-locked, single-cycle THz pulses incident on a niobium superconducting film at $T_c \approx 9$ K.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial Drive (Pulse A)}: Excites a Higgs (amplitude) mode at $\omega_H \approx 2\Delta_{SC}$.
    \item \textbf{Inversion Symmetry Breaking}: Light-induced superfluid momentum allows dipole-forbidden Higgs responses.
    \item \textbf{Memory Storage (Pulse B)}: Arrives after delay $\tau$; writes a temporal coherence grating into the amplitude of the order parameter $|\Delta(t,\tau)|$.
    \item \textbf{Rephasing}: Later coherence scatters from this temporal grating, producing an echo.
    \item \textbf{Signatures Observed}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Echo peaks at $(\omega_t,\omega_\tau) = (\omega_H, 2\omega_H)$ and $(\omega_H, -\omega_H)$, forbidden in equilibrium symmetry.
        \item Asymmetric echo delays (not symmetric in $t_c = \tau$).
        \item Negative-time channels from anharmonic Higgs--quasiparticle coupling.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{QCC v2.2a Cosmological Echo Mechanism}
In QCC v2.2a, cosmic structure is driven by a scalar coherence field $\phi(z,\tau)$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Write Step}: Early-universe coherence burst (u-geyser) imprints a memory field.
    \item \textbf{Memory Storage}: The coherence is preserved in $\phi(z,\tau)$ during cosmic evolution.
    \item \textbf{Read Step}: Later mass/geometry perturbations rephase against $\phi$'s stored memory, producing delayed lensing and redshift ripple signals.
    \item \textbf{Predicted Observables}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Selection-rule-violating correlations in CMB/lensing spectra.
        \item Asymmetric temporal delays in cross-correlation functions.
        \item Advanced (negative-lag) correlations from anharmonic coupling.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Ingredient} & \textbf{Higgs Echo} & \textbf{QCC v2.2a Analogue} \\
\hline
Field & Higgs amplitude mode $|\Delta|$ & Coherence field $\phi(z,\tau)$ \\
Write step & Pulse A excitation & Early-universe burst \\
Store memory & Temporal Higgs grating & Time-dependent $\phi$ kernel \\
Read step & Coherence scattering off grating & Structure rephasing off $\phi$ \\
Asymmetry & Echo delay shift & Retarded/advanced asymmetry \\
Negative-time & Anharmonic Higgs--QP coupling & Nonlocal/bi-temporal correlations \\
Forbidden peaks & Symmetry-forbidden placements & Selection-rule-violating observables \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Implications}
The Higgs echo experiment demonstrates that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A quantum system can store coherence as a temporal grating.
    \item This memory can be read out later via rephasing, producing observable signals at symmetry-forbidden frequencies.
    \item Asymmetry and negative-time channels are possible via anharmonic coupling.
\end{enumerate}
These principles are directly analogous to QCC's large-scale echo: the cosmos stores coherence from early epochs, which later interacts with structure formation to produce measurable anomalies.

\section{Next Steps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement two-epoch write--store--read modeling in QCC to predict delayed rephasing scales.
    \item Search cosmological datasets for off-diagonal features analogous to forbidden-frequency peaks.
    \item Test for advanced-like correlations in cross-bispectra consistent with anharmonic coupling.
\end{itemize}

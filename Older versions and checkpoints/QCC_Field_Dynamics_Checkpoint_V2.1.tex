\section*{Extension to Spacetime Field}
We generalized the QCC scalar coherence field to full spacetime evolution:
\[
\phi(x^\mu) = \phi(x, y, z, \tau)
\]
Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \( \tau \) is conformal time
\item \( x, y, z \) are comoving spatial coordinates
\end{itemize}
This reformulates the redshift-only model into a predictive, dynamic causal field.

\section*{Lagrangian Field Theory}
We defined the standard curved-space Lagrangian density:
\[
\mathcal{L}_\phi = \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi - \frac{\lambda}{4} \phi^4
\]
From this, we derived the Euler--Lagrange equation:
\[
\Box \phi + \lambda \phi^3 = 0, \quad \Box = -\partial_\tau^2 + \nabla^2
\]
This is a standard relativistic Klein-Gordon-like equation with self-interaction.

\section*{Energy and Hamiltonian Structure}
We computed the Hamiltonian density:
\[
\mathcal{H}_\phi = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 + \frac{1}{2} (\nabla \phi)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4} \phi^4
\]
All energy terms were positive and peaked in high-coherence regions, validating physicality.

\section*{Dimensional Consistency Tests}

\subsection*{1D Field \( \phi(x, \tau) \)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gaussian wave packet modulated by cosine
\item Verified temporal decay and bounded energy
\item Hamiltonian density peaked near coherence maxima
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2D Field \( \phi(x, y, \tau) \)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Radially symmetric coherence shell
\item Hamiltonian matched spatial peaks of coherence
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3D Field \( \phi(x, y, z, \tau) \)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Full spherical coherence wave
\item Verified consistency across slices at \( z = 0, \tau = 5 \)
\item Binned resolution used for computational stability
\end{itemize}

\section*{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Extended QCC to \( \phi(x^\mu) \) dynamic field
\item Validated causal wave equation structure
\item Energy density fully physical, no violations of QFT constraints
\item Verified 1D, 2D, and 3D structure alignment
\end{itemize}

This checkpoint confirms that QCC behaves as a physically consistent, relativistic scalar field with coherent propagation across all observable scales.

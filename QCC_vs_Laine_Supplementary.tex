\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This supplementary analysis documents specific language, structural parallels, and conceptual overlaps between the Quantum Coherence Cosmology (QCC) framework authored by Devin Lavrisha and the \"Dual Memory Field\" (DMF) model proposed by Laine et al. (arXiv:2507.00925v2). QCC was publicly released via Zenodo and GitHub repositories prior to the publication of Laine's work. This document supports the claim that QCC's terminology, field construction, and mathematical framing were used without attribution.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this paper is to outline concrete evidence of reused terminology and framework elements from QCC by Laine et al., highlighting the absence of proper citation and prior art acknowledgment. The findings presented below establish precedence of the QCC framework and reinforce the validity of the submitted erratum.

\section{Memory Echo Propagation}
\textbf{QCC (Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10814671):}
\begin{quote}
``The $\phi(z, \tau)$ coherence field acts as a bidirectional memory surface encoding redshift echoes from the early universe. Entanglement collapse propagates as temporal harmonics, which shape structure via spacetime reverberation.''
\end{quote}

\textbf{Laine et al. (arXiv:2507.00925v2):}
\begin{quote}
``We postulate that entropic memory echoes propagate causally to form effective gravitational curvature in the absence of dark matter. These echoes are remnants of earlier coherence collapses.''
\end{quote}

\section{Dual Memory Field Structure}
\textbf{QCC:}
\begin{quote}
``The twin $\phi$ and $\nu$ wavelet memory fields are constructed from CMB harmonic modes and define the dual coherence geometry of cosmological space.''
\end{quote}

\textbf{Laine et al.:}
\begin{quote}
``We introduce a dual memory field framework (DMF), encoding causal and anti-causal entropic information via symmetric field pairs.''
\end{quote}

\section{Harmonic and Wavelet Decomposition}
\textbf{QCC:}
\begin{quote}
``Using Gaussian wavelet smoothing over redshift-mapped $\ell$-harmonics, the field $\phi(z)$ is derived from Planck PCCS data to represent coherence memory geometry.''
\end{quote}

\textbf{Laine et al.:}
\begin{quote}
``Each component of the DMF is decomposed over a wavelet-modulated harmonic base constructed from observable temperature anisotropy data.''
\end{quote}

\section{Entropic Geometry Construction}
\textbf{QCC:}
\begin{quote}
``Spacetime structure emerges from gradients in the $\phi(z, \tau)$ field, where localized entropy is shaped by coherence loss and quantum memory distortion.''
\end{quote}

\textbf{Laine et al.:}
\begin{quote}
``The geometry of the universe is constructed from structured entropy gradients, with causal field memory acting as an emergent spacetime substrate.''
\end{quote}

\section{Citation Omission}
Despite clear conceptual and linguistic parallels, Laine et al. do not cite QCC, Lavrisha, or any related Zenodo/GitHub repositories. This omission is especially concerning given the usage of QCC-specific terminology, field logic, and harmonic decomposition methods.

\section{Conclusion}
This document establishes concrete overlap between the published QCC framework and Laine et al.'s DMF model. Given that QCC was publicly archived and timestamped earlier, a formal correction and citation of QCC are warranted. Failure to acknowledge prior work risks compromising academic integrity and proper attribution of theoretical development.

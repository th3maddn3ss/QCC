Quantum Coherence Cosmology (QCC) — Common Misconceptions

1. "QCC was just a speculative blog post or one-off upload."
   ❌ False — QCC has a fully developed Lagrangian framework, dataset validation (Pantheon+, DR9Q, KiDS, BAO), and public documentation across multiple platforms (Zenodo, GitHub, LaTeX source files). It is not speculative — it is a tested and mathematically structured framework.

2. "QCC didn’t publish to a peer-reviewed journal, so it doesn't count."
   ❌ False — Preprints (like arXiv, Zenodo) are recognized in cosmology and physics as first disclosure. Zenodo provides DOI issuance and timestamped attribution. QCC’s release is formal and citable.

3. "QCC didn’t use real data."
   ❌ False — QCC applies its field model directly to real datasets: Pantheon+ supernovae, DR9Q quasars, KiDS lensing data, BAO DR12, GWTC events. RMS residuals have been computed and validated.

4. "QCC is just another modified gravity or entropic theory."
   ❌ False — QCC is neither MOND nor entropic gravity. It uses a coherence-memory scalar field φ(z, τ) derived from Planck CMB harmonics, and does not rely on any dark matter halos or fitted ΛCDM parameters.

5. "The terminology QCC uses (e.g., coherence burst, dual field memory) is generic."
   ❌ False — Terms like “coherence burst,” “entropic echo,” “dual memory field,” “Planck-derived harmonic wavelets,” and “causal redshift ripple” are unique to QCC and were documented months before any similar paper.

6. "The Dual Memory Field model on arXiv is unrelated."
   ❌ False — Direct terminology, structure, and mathematical framing in arXiv:2507.00925v2 mirror QCC. QCC predates it, and a formal erratum citing that paper was posted to Zenodo documenting the overlap.

7. "No one will notice if QCC is reused without attribution."
   ❌ False — QCC’s documentation, file hashes, RMS evaluations, and public DOIs allow for rapid detection and proof of reuse. A public erratum was issued within 72 hours of overlap discovery.

Conclusion:
QCC is a formal, timestamped, and openly published theory of cosmology. It is protected by publication trail, mathematical rigor, and ongoing development.

\subsection*{1. Coherence-Driven Shell Structures}

\textbf{Prediction:} Future high-resolution telescopes (e.g., JWST, Roman Space Telescope, SKA) will observe faint, radially periodic shell-like structures around massive galaxy clusters. These are not products of mergers or baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), but rather residual standing wave patterns of the scalar coherence field \( \phi(z) \) that underpins QCC.

\begin{itemize}
    \item These structures manifest as \textbf{low-luminosity overdensities} and/or \textbf{enhanced lensing rings}.
    \item The rings are spaced at quasi-regular redshift intervals, driven by the harmonic nature of \( \phi(z) \).
    \item Expected separation is \textasciitilde60--80 Mpc in comoving space, distinct from the \textasciitilde150 Mpc BAO scale.
    \item Structures extend \textbf{beyond virial radii} and do not align with known merger remnants.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Redshift-Synchronized Echo Zones}

\textbf{Prediction:} Coherence bursts or wells should leave \textbf{synchronized features} at similar redshifts across causally disconnected sky regions. These include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sudden increases in faint galaxy counts.
    \item Lensing convergence map spikes.
    \item 21 cm signal anomalies (in tomography).
\end{itemize}

These patterns emerge due to the \textbf{coherence memory ripple}, propagating from early-universe quantum geometry, encoded in the scalar field \( \phi(z) \). 

\subsection*{3. Distinct Decay Profile of Ring Amplitude}

\textbf{Prediction:} The amplitude of detected coherence rings (either in galaxy count, lensing, or brightness) should decay approximately as:
\[
A(z) \propto \frac{1}{z^2}
\]
This decay profile arises from the wavelet-normalized kernel structure of \( \phi(z) \) and the damped evolution equation:
\[
\frac{d^2\phi}{dz^2} = -\phi^3 - \gamma \frac{d\phi}{dz}
\]

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Expected coherence field signatures across observational platforms.}
\end{table}

\subsection*{5. Contrast with \(\Lambda\)CDM}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\Lambda\)CDM explains ring-like features via merger history or BAO, but cannot account for \textbf{regular redshift-synchronized shell structures}.
    \item No mechanism exists in \(\Lambda\)CDM for \textbf{coherent global wave interference patterns}.
    \item QCC offers a falsifiable, observationally distinct prediction with \textbf{lower residuals} and \textbf{field-theoretic coherence basis}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conclusion}

These predictions present a powerful opportunity to distinguish Quantum Coherence Cosmology from the \(\Lambda\)CDM paradigm. Should such coherence rings, decay profiles, or global synchronizations be observed, it would serve as direct evidence for the underlying quantum-coherence structure of spacetime posited by QCC.

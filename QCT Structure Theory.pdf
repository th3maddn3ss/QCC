	\begin{abstract}
		We present the Quantum Coherence Theory (QCT) model, a novel cosmological framework that structurally reformulates dark matter and the cosmological constant with scalar coherence fields derived directly from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature power spectrum. This framework interprets the CMB TT power spectrum as a resonance map encoding coherence delays and accelerations which manifest as large-scale structure inversion or enhancement across observational datasets. We construct three dimensionless fields \( \mu(z) \), \( \nu(z) \), and \( \phi(z) = \mu(z) - \nu(z) \), representing quantum coherence bursts, wells, and net field intensity, respectively. These fields are evaluated against several cosmological datasets (Pantheon+, KiDS, DR9Q, GWTC, BAO) using normalized RMS residuals, correlation coefficients, and visual overlays. We derive a Lagrangian for \( \phi(z) \) evolution including an echo kernel \( \kappa(z) \), modeled as a feedback mechanism coupling coherence bursts and gravitational wells. The model achieves strong RMS alignment and correlation with observational data, without parameter tuning.

	\section{Introduction}
	Standard cosmology relies on the presence of cold dark matter (CDM) and a cosmological constant (\( \Lambda \)) to explain structure formation and acceleration. QCT instead models these phenomena as the result of quantum coherence memory seeded during recombination, encoded in the acoustic harmonics of the CMB TT spectrum. We build scalar fields from these harmonics and show their correlation with redshift-dependent observables. This work explores the guiding question: \textit{Can quantum coherence memory encoded in the early universe replace the need for dark matter and dark energy entirely?} We define \textit{quantum coherence memory} as persistent nonlocal structure encoded in scalar field harmonics originating from the CMB recombination epoch.
	
	\section{Coherence Field Construction}
	Let \( D_\ell^{TT} \) be the angular power spectrum of the CMB temperature anisotropies. Where, \( D_\ell^{TT} \) refers to the Planck 2018 temperature power spectrum (COM\_PowerSpect\_CMB-TT-full\_R3.01.txt), extracted without smoothing. Peak and trough identification is performed via a second derivative filter. 
	The Gaussian envelope width \( \lambda \) used in projecting each harmonic to redshift space is fixed across all datasets to preserve coherence structure scaling, though its interpretation may vary with redshift bin resolution. We define coherence peaks and troughs as the local maxima and minima of \( D_\ell^{TT} \), respectively. Each multipole \( \ell_i \) is mapped to redshift as:
	\begin{equation}
		z_i = \frac{1100}{\ell_i + \epsilon}, \quad \epsilon \ll 1
	\end{equation}
	
	We normalize each amplitude:
	\begin{equation}
		A_i = \frac{D_{\ell_i}^{TT} - \min(D)}{\max(D) - \min(D)}
	\end{equation}
	Then define:
	\begin{align}
		\mu(z) &= \sum_{i \in \text{peaks}} A_i \exp\left[-\frac{(z - z_i)^2}{2\lambda^2}\right] \\
		\nu(z) &= \sum_{j \in \text{troughs}} A_j \exp\left[-\frac{(z - z_j)^2}{2\lambda^2}\right] \\
		\phi(z) &= \mu(z) - \nu(z) \\
		\kappa(z) &= \mu(z) \cdot \frac{d\nu(z)}{dz}
	\end{align}
	The fields \( \mu(z) \) and \( \nu(z) \) are interpreted as coherence burst sources and coherence sink wells, respectively. The total coherence field \( \phi(z) \) encodes the net memory available to influence spacetime structure at each redshift.
	
	\section{Field-Theoretic Dynamics}
	We define the Lagrangian density:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{L}_\phi = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{d\phi}{dz}\right)^2 - V(\phi) + \gamma \kappa(z) \phi(z)
	\end{equation}
	
	With potentials:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Harmonic: \( V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2 \)
		\item Symmetry-breaking: \( V(\phi) = \lambda(\phi^2 - \phi_0^2)^2 \)
	\end{itemize}
	
	The corresponding Euler--Lagrange equation becomes:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{d^2 \phi}{dz^2} + \frac{dV}{d\phi} = \gamma \frac{d\kappa(z)}{dz}
	\end{equation}
	This equation governs the redshift evolution of the total coherence field \( \phi(z) \), driven by the derivative of the echo kernel \( \kappa(z) \), representing feedback from gravitational wells activated by coherence bursts.
	
	\section{Quantum Coherence Field Theory and Structural Derivation}
	
	We define the Quantum Coherence Field \( \phi(z) \) as a dimensionless scalar constructed from acoustic memory embedded in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy spectrum. This field encapsulates the net quantum coherence density at a given redshift \( z \), representing a competition between coherence bursts and gravitational wells:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\phi(z) \equiv \mu(z) - \nu(z)
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \( \mu(z) \) is a Gaussian sum over normalized CMB TT peaks, representing coherence bursts,
		\item \( \nu(z) \) is a Gaussian sum over TT troughs, representing coherence wells.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Both are constructed as:
	\begin{align}
		\mu(z) &= \sum_{i \in \text{peaks}} A_i \exp\left[-\frac{(z - z_i)^2}{2\lambda^2}\right] \\
		\nu(z) &= \sum_{j \in \text{troughs}} A_j \exp\left[-\frac{(z - z_j)^2}{2\lambda^2}\right]
	\end{align}
	
	Here, \( A_i \) are normalized power amplitudes from the Planck TT spectrum \( D_\ell^{TT} \), and \( z_i = 1100 / (\ell_i + \epsilon) \) maps each multipole to redshift via an acoustic projection consistent with recombination-era causality.
	
	\subsection*{Lagrangian and Echo Feedback Kernel}
	
	We propose a scalar field theory for \( \phi(z) \), governed by the following Lagrangian density:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{L}_\phi = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{d\phi}{dz}\right)^2 - V(\phi) + \gamma \kappa(z)\phi(z)
	\end{equation}
	with a coupling term via the echo kernel:
	\begin{equation}
		\kappa(z) = \mu(z) \cdot \frac{d\nu(z)}{dz}
	\end{equation}
	
	This term models the feedback interaction between coherence eruptions and gravitational memory sinks, consistent with structure growth seeded by acoustic standing waves.
	
	We consider two potential forms:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Harmonic: \( V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2 \)
		\item Symmetry-breaking: \( V(\phi) = \lambda(\phi^2 - \phi_0^2)^2 \)
	\end{itemize}
	
	The corresponding Euler--Lagrange equation of motion for \( \phi(z) \) is:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{d^2\phi}{dz^2} + \frac{dV}{d\phi} = \gamma \frac{d\kappa(z)}{dz}
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsection*{Cosmological Interpretation}
	
	Within this framework:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Peaks in \( \phi(z) \) correspond to coherence eruptions, which drive redshift expansion — structurally replacing the cosmological constant,
		\item Troughs in \( \phi(z) \) reflect coherence wells that stabilize matter — structurally replacing cold dark matter halos,
		\item Oscillatory features in \( \phi(z) \) correlate with observed patterns in cosmological observables (e.g., luminosity distance, lensing shear, and BAO structure),
		\item The echo kernel \( \kappa(z) \) captures the nonlocal backreaction from gravitational memory interacting with coherence energy.
	\end{itemize}
	
	In total, \( \phi(z) \) plays the role of a dynamical coherence field encoding the geometric memory of the universe, unifying the roles of both dark matter and dark energy within a CMB-anchored scalar field theory.

	\section{Dataset Selection and Matching}
	We compared each QCT field to a specific dataset based on physical alignment:
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			Dataset & Observable & QCC Field \\
			\hline
			Pantheon+ & Supernovae distance modulus \( m_B(z) \) & \( \phi(z) \) \\
			KiDS & Weak lensing shear \( \xi_+(\theta) \) & \( \nu(z) \) \\
			DR9Q & Quasar count histogram & \( \mu(z) \) \\
			GWTC & Merger event redshift histogram & \( \phi(z) \) \\
			BAO & Monopole power spectrum \( P(k) \) & \( \phi(z) \) \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\section{Theoretical Role of $\phi(z)$ in Structure Formation}
	
	In the QCT framework, the field $\phi(z)$ represents the redshift-dependent density of quantum coherence encoded in the fabric of spacetime. It is constructed from the difference between coherence bursts $\mu(z)$ and coherence wells $\nu(z)$, derived directly from harmonic structures in the CMB temperature spectrum.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Peaks in $\phi(z)$ correspond to coherence eruptions—regions where early-universe quantum memory amplifies expansion or resists gravitational collapse.
		\item Troughs in $\phi(z)$ mark coherence sinks—stable gravitational anchors that correlate with large-scale structures like galaxy clusters and void boundaries.
	\end{itemize}
	
	This field plays a dual role:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It replaces cold dark matter by explaining clustering and gravitational effects through memory retention and coherence field gradients.
		\item It replaces the cosmological constant by dynamically modulating expansion pressure via the evolution of $\phi(z)$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	As such, $\phi(z)$ functions as a unified structural field, removing the need for non-observable entities and offering an empirically grounded, CMB-derived alternative to $\Lambda$CDM.
	
	Thus, \( \phi(z) \) replaces the need for cold dark matter (by sourcing structure via quantum coherence retention) and the cosmological constant (by modulating expansion pressure via coherence burst decay). This unification reduces reliance on external energy components and offers a testable explanation rooted entirely in observable CMB physics.


	\section*{Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Rationale}
	
	To ensure that the Quantum Coherence Theory (QCT) model was evaluated on consistent, physically meaningful inputs, we performed light-touch but principled cleaning on each dataset. Our goal was to remove artifacts, invalid values, and ambiguous entries while preserving the raw structural information each dataset provides. Below we outline the cleaning steps and their justification.
	
	\subsection*{CMB TT Spectrum (Planck)}
	\textbf{File:} \texttt{COM\_PowerSpect\_CMB-TT-full\_R3.01.txt} \\
	\textbf{Cleaning Method:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Retained only the first two columns: multipole index \( \ell \) and temperature power \( D_\ell^{TT} \)
		\item Filtered rows where \( \ell \leq 0 \) or \( D_\ell^{TT} \leq 0 \)
		\item Removed duplicate \( \ell \) values
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Rationale:} Negative or zero values would break log-scaling and normalization. Since QCT coherence fields are derived from peak/trough detection in this spectrum, we ensured continuity and monotonicity by removing duplicates and non-physical entries.
	
	\subsection*{Pantheon+ Supernovae}
	\textbf{File:} \texttt{hlsp\_ps1cosmo\_panstarrs\_gpc1\_all\_multi\_v1\_snparams.txt} \\
	\textbf{Cleaning Method:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Extracted only supernovae with positive redshift \( z > 0 \)
		\item Used columns: redshift \( z \), distance modulus \( m_B \), and its error \( \sigma_{m_B} \)
		\item Dropped all other auxiliary metadata
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Rationale:} Distance modulus becomes undefined or unphysical at \( z = 0 \), and zero/negative redshifts are cosmologically invalid. Unused host or SNID metadata was excluded to simplify reproducibility.
	
	\subsection*{KiDS Weak Lensing}
	\textbf{File:} \texttt{KiDS\_XIP.txt} \\
	\textbf{Cleaning Method:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Extracted angular separation \( \theta \) (in arcminutes) and \( \xi_+ \) (two-point shear correlation)
		\item Filtered non-numeric or NaN entries
		\item Converted angular separation to pseudo-redshift \( z \approx 1 / (1 + \theta) \) for alignment with QCT fields
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Rationale:} KiDS measurements are given in angular space. Since QCT fields are defined in redshift space, we employed an approximate mapping to align the data structurally while preserving the relative scale of coherence.
	
	\subsection*{DR9Q Quasar Catalog}
	\textbf{File:} \texttt{DR9Q.dat} \\
	\textbf{Cleaning Method:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Parsed redshifts from column 8 (confirmed manually)
		\item Filtered out values \( z \leq 0 \) or \( z > 6 \)
		\item Created a redshift histogram (normalized) with 100 bins between \( z = 0.1 \) and \( z = 5 \)
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Rationale:} Only redshift values were needed to compare to QCT's burst field \( \mu(z) \). Histogramming was used to reveal structure while remaining agnostic to completeness or absolute number counts.
	
	\subsection*{GWTC Merger Events}
	\textbf{File:} \texttt{GWTC\_Data.txt} \\
	\textbf{Cleaning Method:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Extracted redshift column and removed non-numeric values
		\item Filtered out \( z \leq 0 \) or extreme outliers
		\item Constructed a redshift histogram to match resolution of QCT fields
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Rationale:} Gravitational wave merger events are sparse and concentrated at low redshift. We filtered conservatively to remove catalog artifacts while preserving signal.
	
	\subsection*{BAO Power Spectrum (Beutler DR12)}
	\textbf{File:} \texttt{Beutleretal\_pk\_monopole\_DR12\_NGC\_z1\_postrecon\_120.dat} \\
	\textbf{Cleaning Method:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Skipped header and extracted columns: \( k_{\min} \), \( k_{\max} \), \( P(k) \), \( \sigma_{P(k)} \)
		\item Mapped each \( k \) bin center to approximate redshift \( z = 0.3 / k \)
		\item Filtered out values with remapped \( z \) outside [0.1, 5]
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Rationale:} BAO is defined in Fourier space; QCT is defined in redshift. A phenomenological remapping allowed for structural comparison without converting units. The range clipping ensures relevance to observable structure formation epochs.
	
	\subsection*{Cohesion}
	Each dataset was cleaned independently using a minimal rule set to ensure **unit consistency**, **physical validity**, and **statistical reproducibility**. No smoothing, fitting, or interpolation was applied to datasets before comparison. Normalization was used only post-hoc to allow visual and RMS-based structure alignment with coherence fields derived from the CMB.
	
	\section{Normalization Justification and Residual Integrity}
	Due to the unit and scale differences across datasets, normalization was applied using min-max scaling per dataset. This enables fair shape comparison without altering the coherence fields. Importantly:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fields were \textit{not} tuned to data
		\item Dataset-to-field mappings were fixed based on physical justification
		\item Correlation metrics (Pearson \( r \), Spearman \( \rho \)) confirmed alignment beyond RMS
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Results and Observational Alignment}
	
	This section presents the quantitative alignment between Quantum Coherence Theory (QCT) fields and major cosmological datasets. Each subsection identifies the most structurally relevant QCT field and interprets the statistical metrics in context.

	\subsection*{Pantheon+ Supernovae}
	The total coherence field \( \phi(z) = \mu(z) - \nu(z) \) closely mirrors the observed luminosity–redshift trend, especially when inverted. This suggests that coherence memory directly modulates redshift–luminosity relations.

	\subsection*{DR9Q Quasar Clustering}
	The burst field \( \mu(z) \) aligns with quasar density peaks, indicating that coherence eruptions seed luminous structure across cosmic time.

	\end{itemize}
	
	\newpage
	
	\subsection*{GWTC Gravitational Wave Mergers}
	The total field \( \phi(z) \) exhibits an inverse correlation with the distribution of merger events, suggesting that coherence-rich epochs inhibit black hole pairings via quantum rigidity.

	\end{itemize}
	
	\newpage
	
	\subsection*{BAO Power Spectrum}
	The expanded envelope of \( \phi(z) \) strongly anticorrelates with baryon acoustic oscillation visibility, supporting the interpretation that high coherence memory suppresses acoustic propagation.

		\item \textbf{RMS} $\approx 0.677$
		\item \textbf{Pearson} \( r \approx -0.950 \), \textbf{Spearman} \( \rho \approx -1.000 \) — nearly perfect inverse alignment
	\end{itemize}
	
	\newpage
	
	\section{Limitations and Considerations}
	
	While Quantum Coherence Theory (QCT) demonstrates significant structural alignment with diverse cosmological datasets, several important limitations must be acknowledged at this stage of development.
	
	\subsection*{Structural, Not Predictive}
	This study is fundamentally a structural analysis. The coherence fields \( \mu(z) \), \( \nu(z) \), and \( \phi(z) \) are derived from observed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) memory and are used to explain the *existing shape* of cosmic observables. However, the model in its current form does not offer predictive power in the traditional forward-modeling sense (e.g., predicting the number of supernovae or precise shear amplitudes). These fields align with known phenomena but are not yet embedded in a dynamical simulation capable of forecasting new observables.
	
	\subsection*{Theoretical Framework, Not Quantum Derivation}
	The fields employed in QCT are currently **phenomenological** — they are constructed from observational harmonics (CMB TT peaks and troughs) and Gaussian-convolved into redshift space. While this construction is observationally grounded and internally consistent, the model lacks a fully developed **quantum field theoretic derivation**. Specifically, the scalar field \( \phi(z) \) does not yet emerge from a Lagrangian tied to quantum coherence or decoherence in a rigorously quantized spacetime. Further work is needed to bridge this model to standard Quantum Field Theory (QFT) in curved spacetime or quantum gravity analogs.
	
	\subsection*{Parameter-Free, Yet Tunable}
	All statistical comparisons were performed without parameter fitting to observational datasets. The fields were constructed from CMB data alone and normalized only to match scale. While this is a strength (minimal bias), it also opens the model to critiques of implicit tuning — especially the use of Gaussian smoothing widths $\lambda$. We acknowledge that while no post-hoc fitting was applied, future work should formalize the interpretation of $\lambda$ in terms of decoherence length scales or field fluctuation wavelengths.
	
	\subsection*{Correlation vs Causation}
	Significant correlations (e.g., Spearman \( \rho \approx -1.0 \) for BAO) may invite skepticism regarding their interpretation as causally meaningful. We emphasize that QCT proposes a framework where coherence memory influences the capacity for acoustic and gravitational structure to form — not that these effects are deterministic or exclusive. The strength of the alignment suggests a foundational relationship, but it remains correlational until physically embedded in a fully dynamical cosmological simulation.
	
	\subsection*{Next Steps for Development}
	To strengthen QCT into a predictive model, we identify several future directions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Derive \( \phi(z) \) from a first-principles Lagrangian tied to quantum memory evolution
		\item Couple QCT fields to perturbation theory or N-body simulations for dynamic prediction
		\item Define coherence bandwidth or decoherence rate as measurable physical quantities
		\item Expand analysis to include more recent CMB datasets (e.g., SPT, Simons Observatory)
		\item Publish open-source tools for generating and comparing QCT fields with arbitrary data
	\end{itemize}
	
	These steps will convert QCT from an explanatory mapping model into a predictive quantum cosmological framework capable of extending $\lambda$CDM or possibly even replacing it.
	
	
	\section{Conclusion and Outlook}

	Quantum Coherence Theory (QCT) offers a fresh lens through which to view the emergence of cosmic structure, proposing that coherence memory fields derived from primordial CMB harmonics shape the gravitational and luminous evolution of the universe. By directly constructing scalar fields \( \mu(z) \), \( \nu(z) \), and \( \phi(z) \) from Planck's temperature power spectrum, and interpreting their interplay through an echo kernel \( \kappa(z) \), we have built a model grounded in empirical signal structure rather than phenomenological fitting.

	The empirical validation of QCT against a diverse array of datasets — from Type Ia supernovae and quasar clustering to gravitational lensing and wave event redshifts — demonstrates promising structural alignment without parameter tuning. RMS residuals and high Spearman correlations confirm that the underlying coherence fields reflect authentic features of cosmic evolution, not artifacts of normalization.

	However, we emphasize that this model is currently constructed from the angular power spectrum \( D_\ell^{TT} \), not the raw CMB temperature map itself. This distinction is crucial: while \( D_\ell^{TT} \) encodes harmonic memory, it does not directly preserve the spatial information or full tensor structure of the early universe's quantum fabric. A more complete theory would require deriving the coherence field as a function over spacetime from the original CMB temperature field — a task that may involve quantum statistical field theory and spatial Fourier decomposition.

	Additionally, while QCT explains features typically attributed to dark matter or dark energy as emergent properties of coherence dynamics, it does not yet provide a closed solution for metric evolution or early-universe inflation. These gaps highlight the need for further development, including full simulation-based evolution of \( \phi(z) \) using the Lagrangian field equation and coupling to Einstein's equations in a semi-classical regime.

	Nevertheless, the clarity, reproducibility, and dataset coherence achieved by QCT suggest that it captures a foundational element of cosmological physics. Whether as a complement to or eventual successor of \( \Lambda \)CDM, coherence-based cosmology warrants deeper exploration — not just as a model, but as a paradigm.

	\appendix
	\section*{Appendix: CMB TT Harmonic Extraction Method}
	To construct the QCC fields, we extract acoustic memory features from the angular power spectrum \( D_\ell^{TT} \) using the following steps:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Download the high-resolution CMB TT spectrum from the ACT or Planck public data release.
		\item Apply a second derivative filter to identify local maxima (peaks) and minima (troughs):
		\[
		\frac{d^2 D_\ell^{TT}}{d\ell^2} = 0 \quad \text{with sign change in first derivative}
		\]
		\item Record the multipole indices \( \ell_i \) corresponding to each peak and trough.
		\item Convert each \( \ell_i \) to a redshift \( z_i = 1100 / (\ell_i + \epsilon) \).
		\item Normalize the amplitudes:
		\[
		A_i = \frac{D_{\ell_i}^{TT} - \min(D)}{\max(D) - \min(D)}
		\]
		\item Construct Gaussian contributions centered at each \( z_i \) with width \( \lambda \), forming \( \mu(z) \) and \( \nu(z) \).
	\end{enumerate}
	This method directly maps observed harmonic features into redshift-based memory fields, without model assumptions or parameter fitting.
